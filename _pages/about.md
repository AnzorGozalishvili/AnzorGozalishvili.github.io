I am Senior Machine Learning Engineer from Georgia. First I was introduced in AI field in September 2016 when I 
was attending public workshop which was about R for data science and was organized by Data Science Tbilisi community.
I was 3rd course student at Tbilisi State University studying Computer Science. I took many online courses in AI in 
the following 2 years, mostly on Coursera and gained a lot of theoretical knowledge which helped me a lot to get a job. 

I joined [MaxinAI](https://www.maxinai.com/) in February 2018 on Machine Learning Engineer position. 
Currently, I am on Lead ML Engineer position there.  I have done many interesting projects at MaxinAI so far. 
I gained big practical and theoretical knowledge in classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning and Natural Language 
Processing through working with various projects, reading papers, attending and participating in conferences and 
self education. I also got great experience in Tabular data analysis, I was involved in some projects where I built 
Recommender Systems, applied Time Series Analysis and did some Generative Modeling.

I was the member of MaxinAI's [School Of AI](https://github.com/MaxinAI/school-of-ai) where we tought AI
to the people from technical fields for free.

Now I am working on 2 research projects: one is related to Optimal Video Encoding and bitrate ladder prediction and the
other is related to Eye Color Prediction based on human genetic markers.

I think that sharing knowledge and ideas is the way we can develop great AI community around the world. I appreciate 
open-source community and here is my contribution to the AI world!
