I am Senior Machine Learning Engineer from Georgia. First I was introduced in AI field in September 2016 when I 
was attending public workshop in R programming language organized by Data Science Tbilisi. I was 3rd course student at Tbilisi State 
University studying Computer Science. I took many online courses in AI the following 2 years, mostly on Coursera which was amazing. 

I joined [MaxinAI](https://www.maxinai.com/)in February 2018 on Machine Learning Engineer position. 
Currently I am on Lead ML Engineer position.
I have done many interesting projects at MaxinAI so far. 
I gained big knowledge in classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 
Also got huge experience in NLP and Tabular data analysis, I was also involved in some projects in Recommender Systems, 
Computer Vision, Time Series Analysis and Generative Modeling.

I was the member of MaxinAI's [School Of AI](https://github.com/MaxinAI/school-of-ai) where we tought AI
to the people from technical fields for free.

Now I am working on 2 research projects: one is related to Optimal Video Encoding and bitrate ladder prediction and the
other is related to Eye Color Prediction based on human genetic markers.

I think that sharing knowledge and ideas is the way we can develop great AI community around the world. I appreciate 
open-source community and here is my contribution to the AI world!
