I am ML Engineer and Data Scientist enthusiast from Georgia. I got into that field in September 2016 when I 
was studying on Bachelor's of Computer Science. 
Since them I am actively learning ML and Data Science. I joined [MaxinAI](https://www.maxinai.com/) 
in February 2018 on Machine Learning position. Currently I am on Lead ML Engineer position. 

I have done many interesting projects at MaxinAI so far. For detailed view you can see my [CV](/cv/). 
I have big knowledge in classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 
I am highly experienced in NLP and Tabular data analysis Recommender Systems and have some experience in 
Computer Vision, Time Series, Generative Modeling.

I am also the part of MaxinAI's [school-of-ai](https://github.com/MaxinAI/school-of-ai) where we are teaching AI for free
to the people from technical fields.

I think that sharing knowledge and ideas is the way we can develop great AI community around the world. I appreciate 
open-source community and here is my contribution to the AI world!
