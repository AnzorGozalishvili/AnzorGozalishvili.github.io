Summarization is very fun thing. You can save a lot of time by reading book summaries especially when understanding 
general ide is good enough. 
I wanted to check if I could achieve good book summarization using open-source models from Huggingface.
I took a model which was capable of handling large inputs and was trained on book summarization task. [pszemraj/long-t5-tglobal-base-16384-book-summary](https://huggingface.co/pszemraj/long-t5-tglobal-base-16384-book-summary?text=%E2%80%9CThere+will+never+be+great+architects+or+great+architecture+without+great+patrons.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94SIR+EDWIN+LUTYENS+Designing+Your+Perfect+House+is+a+process.+Any+good+design+involves+the+consideration+of+many+criteria+and%2C+ultimately%2C+the+resolution+of+these+criteria+in+a+way+that+maximizes+each+factor+without+sacrificing+any.+You+won%E2%80%99t+find+a+set+formula+for+accomplishing+this+objective%2C+but+if+you+come+to+appreciate+and+understand+the+process%2C+you+will+ultimately+reach+your+goal.+This+process+is+the+means+by+which+you+will+discover+what+Your+Perfect+House+will+be.+The+best+way+to+start+thinking+about+your+house+is+to+decide+what+your+priorities+are.+Some+people+want+a+house+with+great+%E2%80%9Ccurb+appeal%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94i.e.%2C+it+looks+wonderful+from+the+street+and+makes+a+powerful+statement+about+the+owners.+Other+people+value+their+privacy+and+expressly+shun+%E2%80%9Ccurb+appeal%E2%80%9D+in+order+to+create+the+sense+of+seclusion+that+a+home+built+farther+away+from+the+street+affords.+One+family+might+want+to+live+nestled+in+the+woods+with+trees+shading+the+house+while+another+wants+open+spaces+and+a+distant+view.+Some+live+casually+and+prefer+an+open+floor+plan+where+rooms+flow+together.+Others+desire+the+formality+of+a+traditional+layout+with+distinctly+defined+rooms.+Some+people+want+their+homes+to+be+as+ecologically+responsible+and+energy+efficient+as+possible%2C+especially+in+these+days+of+unpredictable+heating+and+energy+costs+and+a+heightened+awareness+of+our+environmental+responsibility.+Others+may+place+a+higher+priority+on+open+views+and+seek+the+feeling+that+they%E2%80%99re+practically+sitting+outdoors+when+they%E2%80%99re+in+the+house.+Although+glass+is+not+as+energy+efficient+as+an+insulated+wall%2C+creating+a+greater+interface+with+nature+has+a+high+value+and+may+necessitate+certain+compromises+in+energy+efficiency+or+have+other+design+implications.+The+right+design+for+you+will+strike+a+balance+between+opposing+issues+like+these.+Some+people+want+to+enjoy+dramatic%2C+soaring+spaces+in+their+homes%3B+however%2C+such+spaces+might+come+at+the+expense+of+additional+rooms+that+could+have+been+built+into+the+same+volume+of+space+on+the+second+floor.+It+is+possible+that+the+space+you+see+as+dramatic+for+your+house+may+strike+others+as+too+tall%2C+echoing%2C+and+cold+for+their+house.+Once+again%2C+the+question+becomes%2C+what%E2%80%99s+most+important+to+you%3F+What+will+be+your+objectives%3F+What+should+Your+Perfect+House+be%3F++A+harsh+fact+of+life+is+that+every+edifice+ever+constructed%2C+with+the+possible+exception+of+Bill+Gates%E2%80%99s+house%2C+has+had+a+budget+attached+to+it.+People+building+their+own+houses+are+willing+to+spend+a+certain+amount+of+money%2C+but+usually+they%E2%80%99re+not+willing+to+spend+every+penny+they+have.+Since+cost+does+act+as+a+ceiling+on+what+can+be+accomplished%2C+everyone+who+wants+to+build+a+house+has+to+make+choices%2C+and+it+is+no+surprise+that+everyone+is+going+to+make+different+choices.+All+of+this+means+that+the+best+house+for+you+is+the+one+that+takes+all+of+your+criteria+and+desires%2C+including+budget%2C+and+manages+to+maximize+all+of+them+without+forsaking+or+ignoring+any+of+them.+The+basic+rule+of+thumb+in+thinking+about+your+new+house+is+that+anything+you+do+affects%2C+alters%2C+or+possibly+limits+something+else.+For+example%2C+if+we+put+an+extra+window+in+a+kitchen%2C+we+are+taking+up+wall+space+that+might+otherwise+have+been+used+for+a+cabinet+or+an+appliance.+Another+constraint+might+be+the+site+itself.+There%E2%80%99s+only+so+much+room+in+any+given+plot+of+land+upon+which+to+create+Your+Perfect+House.+The+canvas+is+only+so+big.+The+crucial+objective+of+your+architect+is+to+design+a+home+in+which+everything+complements+everything+else+so+that+you%2C+the+client%2C+get+as+much+as+possible+out+of+the+space+available+functionally%2C+aesthetically%2C+and+emotionally.+Another+typical+tradeoff+in+house+design+might+involve+the+windows.+Everybody+loves+the+idea+of+having+a+brightly+lit+and+cheery+home.+If%2C+however%2C+you+have+too+many+windows%2C+you+may+wind+up+with+too+much+heat+or+uncomfortably+bright+sunlight+at+different+times+of+the+day.+Lots+of+windows+might+create+too+much+glare+or+may+not+provide+enough+wall+space+for+displaying+your+art+collection.+Design+of+a+house%2C+like+so+many+other+things%2C+comes+down+to+establishing+priorities+and+making+choices.+We+try+adding+a+little+more+of+this+and+a+little+less+of+that+until+we+find+the+right+proportions.+Another+comment+about+the+%E2%80%9CB%E2%80%9D+word%E2%80%94%E2%80%9Cbudget.%E2%80%9D+Perhaps+the+most+basic+criterion+for+perfection+is+simply+keeping+the+house+%E2%80%9Con+budget.%E2%80%9D+No+matter+the+size+of+the+budget%2C+for+a+design+to+be+good+it+should+always+be+an+efficient+use+of+the+available+funds.+We+are+familiar+with+dealing+with

I have recently read this book: [Design Your Perfect House](https://books.google.ge/books/about/Designing_Your_Perfect_House.html?id=0bSgxwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y).
But it's hard to remember everything so I had to revisit chapters to remind things. I had an idea to create a book summary 
which might help me to review this book quickly. It took me just 3-4hrs from book summary generation to writing this blog.
Let's see how the results look:

# Book Summary

## Lesson One

"Race for the UndergroundestatedWe're Notifying Each other About This.a.usmhbackhall.heart
### BEGINNING THE JOURNEY

In this chapter, the narrator tells us that architect is "frozen music." He says that his clients are unique and that each house must be designed to fit their individual desires and wants. One day, a client asks him to design her a house because she wants it to be the most beautiful house ever designed. When he says that he hopes all of his clients feel their houses are the best house he's ever designed, he doesn't mean that they should think about their own dream houses. The only thing that makes a home truly unique is the people who live in it. That's why you have to listen to your personal needs and desires before you can make an informed decision about how to build a great house.
### The Magical, Mystical World of Feel

In this chapter, the narrator explains how important it is to have a clear idea of what the house will be like. He uses a classic Georgian style house as an example. This house feels right because there are four rooms in the house that occupy one corner of the square plan. The main hallway and staircase connect the two sides of the house. A house with a four-square plan organizes all the other rooms into one big hall. It also makes the house feel orderly and organized. For example, a house with only four rooms occupies one part of the main floor. If you were to walk into your house and say, "I know what this home is all about, I can't put my fingers on it but I'm uncomfortable here. Our minds need to find order out of Chaos. These are the most important aspects of what makes houses feel right.
### Your Opinion Counts

The next time you see a house design, ask your architect to critique it as it comes up. If things don't seem to work for you, tell your architect. He will be able to explain things again and even draw additional sketches. Don't be afraid of being intimidated by your architect; trust your judgment. Even the most talented architect can't fit into everyone else's ideas. Instead, take an imaginary path through the house and imagine yourself living there.
### What Is Architecture?

In this chapter, the narrator explains how architecture is defined and how it is accomplished. He uses the example of a backyard terrace as an example. A terrace is defined by the elements that define it, such as stones paving and stone walling. The quality of this space is influenced by its details, which define its surface, edge, andorientation
### From Space to Place

In this chapter, Tommo explains three kinds of space: boundless space, defined space, and architectural space. He uses the example of the White House as an example. Both are places that people find memorable.
### The Language of Architecture

In this chapter, the narrator explains how people use words to communicate. The word "friend" is innocent enough but what power does it have in this context? An example of architecture that is pregnant and meaningless is the roof. It was used extensively in France during the 17th century as a symbol of franklin Mansart. Today, however, it has become a common term for a fast food restaurant. On the inside, the parts must serve a purpose, but as we look outside, buildings frame us and convey emotions. There are cathedrals, steeply pitched roofs, and arches. All these elements express moods and sentiments.
### Architectural Grammar

The narrator uses the example of a house as an example of how buildings are constructed. Each room is the building block of the design, and each room must respond to the action it expresses. There are many different types of doorways and windows that can be used to create different kinds of movement between rooms. Some doors become so wide that they completely occupy the edge of the room; others are so small that they blur the line between indoor and outdoor. Sometimes there is also a direct connection between languages. For example, in the Persian word "paradize," the word derives from the word "walled garden." In this instance, the language has evolved to convey the feeling of such a garden because of the way it is protected from the elements. Other words like "walled garden" and "exciting features" have also become part of the English language. These words serve as prose for the architecture.

### MAKING THE HOUSE A HOME

In this chapter, we're going to get a little more in-depth on the concept of architecture and how it can help create a truly perfect home. It doesn't matter what you think of your house, though: it just depends on you.
### Sequential Progressions—Our Minds Seek Order

In this chapter, Linda explains how people find order in the world and how they don't like to move from public places to private places. She explains that we want to have a sequence of increasingly private spaces, starting with the master bedroom and ending with the most private ones.
### Designing Spaces

Basically, the architect thinks in terms of space more than objects when they create a house. He starts by saying that an open field is a huge space and then moves on to explain how people will feel when they are outside it. For example, if you walk into a park and see a giant tree, you'll feel connected to it because there's no place for you to hide. You can also feel connected with the Washington monument which is taller than the one in this picture. Then we get to the world of buildings as well. When we go out to a restaurant, we find ourselves sitting next to someone else who has less personal space. We do this when we stand next to another person or thing. Everyone knows when they want to sit closer to someone and when they don't want to. In other words, we have a tendency to become uncomfortable when we look at something too big.
### Controlling Scale—Keeping It Human

In this chapter, we're introduced to the concept of human scale in architecture. It's used to create buildings that reflect the size of people. For example, a room with a big enough dining table might be awkward for Fred because his friends won't be able to enjoy eating there. Instead, hotel owners use trees and ficus to create a more realistic ceiling.
### How to “People” Spaces

In this chapter, we learn how to create people-friendly spaces. Mr. Lorry Lyndon, an architect at the university, taught a lecture on how to "people" spaces. He explained that it was important to make for comfortable places where people could live and work. He also talked about windows of appearance, which were windows with proportions that hint at someone's presence. Another way to create space for people is to include materials that indicate another person in the creation. This includes wood, stone, and other natural materials. People love these things because they feel like they are part of something larger than themselves. They can imagine themselves sitting in chairs or standing on top of a wall. Finally, he talks about creating places for people to interact without planning. These places might be enclosed or have walls surrounding them. A terrace would be more comfortable since there are plants around it. The fourth method of peopling would be to include human handwork in their creation. If you want to paint or have been cleaned recently, you need to do so. But many items fall short in aesthetics because they don't require any attention from humans. It seems counterintuitively that some items tend to get neglected. So instead, people go to trade fairs and find all sorts of interesting things. There are lots of different kinds of artifacts that remind us of our family. One thing that makes houses feel right is the sense that everything is right-sized and appropriate for its uses. That's what makes a home feel right.

### UNIFYING THE DESIGN

The next day, we're going to discuss some of the most important things a house can do. In this chapter, we get a brief introduction to architect Le Breck, and what it means to be an architect.
### The Axis

The first chapter introduces the concept of an axis; it is used to describe the relationship between rooms on an axe. A central, vertical line represents unity and clarity. An architect can use this principle to organize a house in any way that makes it feel right. In other words, efficiency isn't always the goal of building. It's just a matter of budget.
### Symmetry and Composition

The point is that symmetry can create a structure that becomes less interesting and interesting. It has its place, but it doesn't have the same purpose as creating balance and harmony in buildings.
### The Golden Mean

In this chapter, we continue our discussion of proportions with a classic example: the Golden Mean. It's the classic method for organizing and proportionating things in art and architecture that was used throughout Greek and Roman history. The Golden Mean works just as well today because it always works
### Breaking the Pattern for a Reason

This chapter introduces the concept of a day-night pattern, which is used to establish a strong and rigid pattern in a house. The principle behind this is that once a pattern has been established, it can be broken down and used to create variations. For example, Le Corbuser would move one of his columns so that the stairs would be placed where he desired it to be
### Angles and Curves

In this chapter, we continue with our discussion of the use of angles and curvatures in building designs. We start by outlining how important they are in creating a pleasing and coherent design.
### Changes in Height, Light, and Scale

At the end of this chapter, we get a quick lesson in how to vary the size of a house: you can use different heights and different kinds of light to create different moods. For instance, imagine that your front door is taller than the rest of your house because it's so big. But when you walk into the room beyond the grand staircase, you feel smaller.
### Changes in Materials

The narrator goes on to describe how the different types of materials used in building your house will convey messages about the character of the space. For instance, a marble entryway will make a transition between public and private. A stone floor will make for a welcoming area, but it is not as strong as a warm wooden floor. It says "durability." It reflects sounds. So when we want to read a book, we want something comfortable, warm, and quiet. This is where the wood floor will help us feel like we are in a private space.
### The Joy of Focal Points

The next time you're in your house, think about a dark and depressed hallway. It won't be so bad. You can make it more pleasant by adding some nice things there, like a picture of a beautiful fountain or a sculpture. When you enter the hallway, you'll be transported to that place by the beauty of the fountain or the sculpture.
### Just Say No to Avocado

In this chapter, the narrator gives us a simple warning: to be careful of style. It doesn't matter what style you choose, as long as it lives up to its principles and is timeless.
### Don’t Be a Slave to Examples

Often, when clients ask for help in finding an architect, they are surprised that they don't know anyone who can design the house they want. In this chapter, Tommo shows how he uses his experience in designing houses in Hawaii to create a unique and authentic house. He takes advantage of his knowledge of the island to understand what the client wants and then combine it with the needs of the home. The result is a two-story house that looks like it was built in the 1900s but retains its integrity.
### But My Builder Says He Can’t Do That

In this chapter, Jim explains how everyone on the construction team plays a part in the project. From the start, every single person on the builder's team must play a role. It is important to remember that each of these people has a different role to play: the builders are skilled and knowledgeable, but they don't necessarily answer those "what if" questions. The architect is the one who deals with ideas and possibilities. He will not be afraid to tell you something bad about it. But even if your builder does want to do it, he won't always agree with what you ask for. Sometimes, however, an idea can turn out to be really interesting. That is, when the entire building team is engaged and invested in the final product, good ideas crop up from the sub-contractors,the builder, and the architect.

### INTO THE DEPTHS OF DESIGN

In this chapter, the narrator explains how people find pleasure in the things they see and hear. He uses a metaphor to explain how we like things more when everything around us isn't obvious until we experience it. Art, music, dance, and architecture are all examples of this kind of multivalent experience. When we first see a house, however, there's too much going on for us to notice at once. We can actually begin to get an appreciation for how well-designed the house is.
### “God Is in the Details”

In this chapter, we're going to explore the concept of repeating a particular detail throughout your home. It can be as simple as a diamond motif on the floor or a sea turtle pattern on the mantel breast. Whatever it is, though, it will make the house more complete and complete.
### Thick Walls, Solid Home

The narrator emphasizes the importance of thick walls in a house, noting that there are some exceptions to this. For example, a wall that is only two-inch wide can feel thin when it is finished. Thin walls also give a feeling of security and stability.
### Provide Something Unexpected

In this chapter, Linda explains how she uses eccentricity in her house design to create a sense of place. She describes how she created a meditation space for her clients and made it out of the attic. It would have been impossible for them to make this space their own since they could not easily get there from their home.
### The Importance of Nostalgia

Now that we've established that you don't need to have a fancy house plan to make your dream come true, it's time to start thinking about how everything in your new home will look.
### Zones of Retreat

When he was studying architecture at the university, his thesis project was to design a Psychiatric Hospital. He wanted to create a place for people with mental illness to feel safe and secure. He called this space "our zone of retreat," because it was where we would hide when things got too stressful. Everyone needs a private space that they can use to escape from the stresses of everyday life. For him, this is his home office; for someone else, there is a study or a library. In other words, all of us need our own private space. It doesn't matter how big or small the room is, whether it's a bedroom, a playroom, or even a doctor's office. If you have a lot of people living in your house, it makes sense to have different kinds of rooms so that everyone can interact comfortably.
### Flow

In this chapter, the narrator explains how flow and order in a house work. He uses the analogy of a stream to explain how people move from one room to another within a home. Good flow implies that there is a "unified and psychological connectedness" that feels like things are in the right sequence. People often talk about how they like the way the house flows because it means that everything is in order. This quality is the signature of good design; it has no abrupt changes. Public places don't crash into private rooms. Outside spaces transition smoothly between indoor and outdoor spaces. Things appear ordered and feel ordered. Gestalt psychology tells us that the entire is different from its parts. A brick wall is made up of only one identity. The whole is different than all the other parts of an individual brick.
### Light

In this chapter, we get a closer look at how light is used in the house. He discusses how people are comfortable in rooms with windows on both sides and how they can use artificial light to create different levels of light. For instance, a dining-room might have five different kinds: a chandelier over the table; a dimmer switch over the dining room; recessed lighting near the ceiling; wall Sconces; and a fifth type of lighting known as "layering" that uses switches to control the intensity of the light. When the guests arrive at a party, the dining hall will be lit up all night with all five types of light giving the feeling of beauty and dramatic activity. Then when the guests leave, the dinner room will be set up with all Five Types of Light contributing to the Feel of Beauty and Drama
### The Third Dimension

In this chapter, the narrator explains some of the common mistakes that people make when they start to plan a house. These mistakes include using too many different colors and materials in one house, making too much of a single wall, using too much window space, etc.
## Lesson Five

### WHAT WILL YOUR HOUSE BE?

The process of creating a perfect house starts with an understanding of what people want and how to create the right space for them. There are many different kinds of people that have different needs and desires, but they all come up with the same basic goal: to create a home that meets their needs.
### Why Build a House?

The architect, explains, is like a suit designer who custom makes for you rather than buying an already-built suit. When the house is built, it becomes a "reflection of who you" and what your lifestyle is all about; it allows you to achieve great success in life. He says that his clients often have a strong aesthetic sense and are happy with their new home because they know what they need in life and want to achieve its best. They never fear trying to make things happen, and when they build their own house, they get to achieve incredible results. Many people hear horror stories about building mistakes and delays during the early stages of construction. But these stories don't have to occur: more time and effort will go into building a perfect house. Just as important as planning is to create a perfectly-fitting house, having the right team members can help avoid many common pitfalls. Poor planning can lead to surprises later. For example, if one part of the house does not fit into the budget offered by the builder, another part ofthe house might be too big or too small for the needs of the family. This could result in even more costing out of the contract. You should adjust the allowances accordingly so that you won't spend more money on extra items. If you end up spending more on those allowances, this will increase the total project cost. Miscommunication and misunderstood decisions can also lead to bad decisions. One example of such unintended compromises involves placing a powder room next to the kitchen while guests are dining. This way, any noises from the room are heard throughout the meal. Instead, guests have to leave the powder room upstairs instead of going downstairs to use one
### Do I Need an Architect?

The majority of new houses don't have an architect on board, and the narrator suggests that you hire an architect to help you through the entire process. An architect creates the plans, determines what the builder should do, and then creates drawings for the house so that the manufacturer will know how to build it. This way, the house will reflect upon you as the owner. Sometimes builders feel as though they are the "quarters" of the team; this is because they have many other subcontractors and clients to oversee the work. As an architect, your job is to unify all of the different parts of the house into one coherent whole. In other words, every project has two distinct sides: the aesthetic side and the subjective side. A good architect will not only listen to your needs but also understand everything about the building itself. He will be more likely to see problems in the construction or during the design phase. Even a business partner can benefit from having a good relationship with an architect. There is no room for grandencing when it comes time to creatingYour Perfect House
### Choosing the Right Architect

In this chapter, the narrator explains how people find and hire an architect by asking his portfolio of designs. He emphasizes that experience is important in selecting an architect because it will help you get past those who have already designed houses for other clients. Also, some architects pass the project off to "back room" junior designers so that they can keep control over the entire process. If you are planning a house yourself, ask your architect about who will actually do the work. You don't need an experienced architect with large offices; just ask him what he will do. A lot of newer, less experienced, and veteran architects seem to be better at taking on larger projects than older, more experienced ones. One day, there was a huge Molasses Tank disaster in Boston. It turned out that the company had improperly painted the tank brown as a way to hide the problem from the rest of the building community. Later, lawyers found out that all of the companies were cheating on their steel plates during the construction of the giant vessel. The explosion caused the builder to start using building codes and begin inspecting the buildings before they go to market. Accountability has been born.
### The Wright Way

In this chapter, Tommo explains how Frank Lloyd Wright was one the most important men in American architecture. He was not client-oriented, but rather, he wanted his clients to love what he had created. His houses were "the gold standard" of house design for generations, and he believed that everyone should have their own home. For example: Johnson Wax built a house with a long skylight above the dining room table, which leaks when it rains. Wright believed that every house should be "of" the land instead of "on" the property. This means that an architect shouldn't be treating his clients the way Frank did. If they aren't attentive to their needs, they won't get them exactly right. Instead, they should find someone who can guide them through the process of building their perfect house.
### Interior Designer and Landscape Architect

The other two people who may play an important part in the planning of your home will be a landscape designer and an inside designer. If you have a property that is not large, difficult, or unique, it might be best to hire an interior designer instead of an architect. An experienced interior designer can help you with everything from selecting colors and finishes to building details.
### Design/Build

In this chapter, Linda explains how the concept of "psemi-design/ build" works. She calls it a one-stop shop for a new house. The difference between these two types of shopping is that you don't have to hire an architect, interior designer, or landscaper; instead, you get a single agreement with the design company. You can do whatever you want with the house, but there will be no guarantees. If you like the plan, however, you won't be happy until you find out that the builder actually has something in mind for your needs. There are other options: A completely custom-built house from an independent architect can also be arranged. This type of arrangement involves both the design services and the construction of the home.
### Site Unseen

The first step in the house planning process is to choose a site. This will allow you to see exactly how the house will fit on the lot, and it will also give you an idea of what the house can look like before it is built. As you work with your architect, you will begin to realize how wonderful Your Perfect House truly is.

### MAKE PLANS BEFORE DRAWING PLANS

In this chapter, Henry explains how to control the building process so that you don't have to waste as much money as possible. First, find the right people and plan. Second, plan.
### How You Really Live

The next step is to think through the lifestyle issues that are driving your concept ofYour Perfect House. Some people want a big, communal living space with a kitchen and a fireplace, while others want an airy, indoor space with lots of windows. These kinds of issues drive the house building process. Remembering places you've been that remind you of home will help you control the entire process. For example, if he wants to build a house in a hot southern climate, he might have to sacrifice a view by using more windows. The architect would be able not only to control the amount of glass in the wall but also to figure out how much heat and light will flow into the house.
### Critical Design Questions

The next step is to figure out how much the house will cost. Start by asking yourself some questions, such as: "What are the size of the project?" And then talk to builders and find out what they're willing to charge for the lot you want. Once you have a better idea, start planning. You can hire an architect or builder to do this, so long as you choose a good building site and make sure that everything works out financially. After all, it's not like you'll be able to pay every penny until you get your house.
### “Green” Mansions

In this chapter, Jim explains how people are starting to think about building "green" houses. He uses an example of a French country house that cost only $100 per month for heat and cool but was well-planned and built with energy-efficiency in mind. This isn't just any house; it's also a good way to make sure that you're using as much energy as possible. It's important to have proper planning and materials in place so that the house can be built efficiently. The most important thing to do is to get your house on the right site. There are lots of different kinds of mechanical systems out there, but they all work very well because they provide enough airflow and sound. So many more things can be done behind the scenes to help save money. For example, some power companies offer residential customers a choice between switching from a high-rate residential bill to a lower-rate demand bill. This will save them about one third on their electricity bill and contribute to less pollution by the power plants. You can build a whole lot of these things while saving money at the same time.
### Sidewalk Superintendents

The first thing the narrator wants to tell us is that there's one method of controlling the cost of building your house that doesn't really work. For example, sometimes people get excited about building and want to tour their house without consulting their architect or make sure they don't change things too much. That way, when the builder comes to talk to the subcontractors on the jobsite, they won't be surprised by how much more expensive it would be to do the same thing. In other words, what might seem like an easy conversation between the owner and his subcontractor may actually end up costing you more than it actually is. This is why the best strategy for keeping control over costs is to avoid talking to anyone but your architect/builder. It's better to have a few "casual conversations" with the subconsequences instead of trying to figure out how much money they're going to spend on a house just by talking to them.

### CHOOSING THE PERFECT SITE

In this chapter, Frank gives some practical advice on how to plan a house. He says that before starting the actual building process, it's important to get a basic idea of what you want and where you want to build. This will help you figure out whether or not the house is going to be a good fit.
### Zoning, Land Use Ordinances, and Covenants

In this chapter, Dr. Rivers explains how to find the right kind of property for your new home. The first thing you should do is check out the town's zoning regulations and land use rules. Some communities have restrictions on how tall buildings can be or how close they can be to their property lines. Other towns have "height restrictions," which keep sightlines to everyone. You also need to make sure that your lot has enough water and sewer for your house so that you can get it in shape.
### Lot Size and Buildable Area

The house has to be built big enough to fit everything that is needed for the house, including the garage and driveway. There are also other things to consider when planning out the lot: setbacks; easements; and landscaping.
### Orientation

In this chapter, the narrator gives tips on how to position a house in an advantageous location. He suggests that houses should be oriented toward one side of the property, which will allow for as much sunlight as possible. This will also help keep the house warm during the winter and cool during the summer. A house facing the east is good in any climate because the morning sun is not too hot. The house facing south is best because it can help control the western sun. It also has the advantage of being close to the Pacific Ocean.
### Howdy, Neighbor

The narrator discusses the three different vantage points of view that can be used to create a beautiful picture of a house. He suggests that people should think about how their house will appear from these three vantagepoints and then make sure that they don't move too close to them. If they do move, they won't have to worry about what happens to the land next door or across the road because it might become a lot of new houses. This is one of the most common reasons why neighbors hate building on their property. It is also one reason why many people are angry when they hear that the local airport is going to grow up. These neighbors usually live in an area where there is growing economy and they want nothing to do with development. One solution is to purchase "view easement," which allows you to keep your house looking out over rice fields without worrying about selling it to anyone. Another advantage of buying property adjacent to a nearby golf course is that it gives you more value than interior lots since it doesn't involve mowing the grass.
### Slope

In this chapter, the narrator discusses the various kinds of slopes that can be used to create a house that looks pleasing from outside. He warns that most people avoid sites with steep slopes because they make it feel like they are driving on the roof and not visible from inside. Other options include taller windows and doors and more wall-to-wall surfaces. A house with a steep uphill slope will also cause physical challenges because it has to be climbed all the way to the front door as well as from the garage. Some houses sit on cross slopes, which allow them to plan rooms on the upper floor so that they don't look awkward. Another problem is dealing with water. When you have a runoff from a storm, it makes it difficult to get water out of your house.
### Views

In this chapter, we're going to focus on how important it is to have a beautiful view. First, we need to figure out whether there's any glare coming from the water or from the house itself. If there are, that might be because the house faces out into the sunset. But if it's not, then people will always come to the house from one direction. This is why you want to make sure your house has a good view.
### Boulders, Trees, and Other Physical Features

The narrator offers several more myths about building sites, including that large boulders will make a big problem. There are also many false stories about why you should dig for rock in order to determine where there is rock under the property. In these cases, it is better to hire an engineer or arborist to conduct a proper site analysis and to determine how much of the property needs to be subdivided. For example, some new developments have no regard for trees on their property because they want to build as many buildings as possible without considering where they can get them. This means that builders often cut down trees in tract homes because there is little regard for where they need to uprooted them. To prevent this, however, planners designate sensitive areas as "common property," thus saving valuable building lots from being sold.
### Noise and Wind

In the first few chapters of this book, you will learn about some of the most common problems that can arise from a new home being built under a flight path. These problems may include noise, traffic, and other potential drawbacks.
### Problem Lots

This chapter discusses the concept of crisis and opportunity. It applies to lots that are not in line with the typical expectations of builders, home buyers, and architects. Sometimes there will be lots that don't meet these expectations. These lots can actually provide exciting opportunities for houses on unusual lots. If you have a lot that doesn't fit into your standard building footprint, it might be time to buy it. Don't worry, though; problem lots can save you money because they get passed over without imagination.
### Reading a Site Plan

In this lesson, we're going to take a closer look at the importance of having a proper site plan. A good site plan will give you all the details you need about the property and its location. It also gives you an idea of how the house will be set up.
## Lesson Eight

### PROGRAMMING THE HOUSE

After you have selected a location, it's time to get started planning the house. The first step is to list out all of your specific needs and desires. Next, you need to figure out how many rooms you want and how big each room should be. This isn't exactly a straightforward process, but it does give you an opportunity to think about things as you go along. For instance, you might want a kitchen that overlooks a children's playroom so that they can cook meals together without disturbing the family. Also, you don't want to make the kitchen noisy or smell like food. At this point, you also need to decide how much closet space you need and what kind of specialty rooms you need. Once you have finished thinking about these things, it will be time to write down the rooms and target size.
### Putting Walls and Ceilings around Spaces

The first step in the process of building a house is to define the physical space. It is important to know how much space each room needs so that the finished product will be comfortable and useful.
### Why Did They Ever Call It a Living Room?

In this chapter, we get a better idea of how people live and why they don't often have a great room or a study. This is because there are so many people in the house that it can be hard to find a space that is big enough for all of them. Also, traditional living rooms aren't very comfortable because they are located in an area where nobody goes.
### Programming Equals Learning

In this chapter, we get a little more in-depth on how you can use word processors to help you organize and categorize your rooms.
### A Matter of Style

The narrator tells us that style is just one of many things to be considered in the design of a house. It's important to understand how you want your house to look, and to find out what it can be. He suggests that you decide by looking at magazines and asking yourself what you like firsthand. This will help you create a wishlist of things you want in your new home.
### Balancing and Maximizing Priorities

The purpose of the house design is to create an elegant, well-furnished home that meets all of your desires at a reasonable price. In addition, the house will be much more comfortable and secure than one that is built on a tight budget.
### A Reality Test

In this chapter, the narrator describes how he uses cost per squarefoot to calculate the cost of building a house. He starts by assigning each room a hypothetical amount of space and then multiplying the total square feet by the cost per foot to get an accurate cost figure. An elevator is one expense that many people want to save money on, but it can also be advantageous when paying for it. If the floor plan does not match your budget, it will be difficult to determine what the actual cost will be. It is better to talk to your architect before you start planning so that they can help you figure out exactly how much the house will cost than to wait until later to find out how much it will actually cost.

### PUTTING PENCIL TO PAPER

In this chapter, Charles Dickens explains how he usually starts with the first floor of his house. This is where most of the important things in the house will be located.
### Tiny Bubbles

The architect begins to sketch out the various rooms in the house, using bubbles as a way to represent the relationships that must be built between them. He will draw these bubbles again and again until he gets one that meets the program requirements. This is the early phase of design, when an architect really wants to understand how everything works together. He might use sketches on a piece of paper or pencil to help him get his ideas down. After all, it's not like you're just going to sit down and say, "hey, I want this idea but I don't know what it is." So your architect will often roll out drawings of other ideas or options while he's still trying to build the house.
### Where to Park?

In this chapter, the narrator explains how to plan a house so that it has the largest space possible. He starts by describing how people usually want a large garage and then proceeds to explain how you should plan for it.
### It’s a Sequential Thing

In this chapter, we're going to walk through the entire process of building a house. First, we need to figure out where the garage will be located. Next, we want to figure things out about how people will live in the house. Then, we get to the big rooms: the kitchen, dining room, and other communal areas. This is all part of the whole planning process. It's not just about making sure everything is okay; it's also about creating the illusion of space. We don't know yet what the final product will look like yet, but we can definitely start thinking about it now.
## Lesson Ten

### DESIGNING THE HOUSE

In this chapter, we're going to get a little more into the process of building a house. First, let's get some background on how the architect will actually create the initial drawings for the house.
### Designing the Site Concept—Working with the Land

In this chapter, we're going to get a little more in-depth on how to create the best view possible. We talked about how important it is to have rooms that capture the most views, but there are still some things you need to keep in mind. For example, if you want to walk out into the yard directly to the house, you might have to move one room closer to the other side of the property so that no one will see your house. If you don't want to build up all the dirt under the garage and drive, you can build a deck above the ground instead.
### Watch the Weather

In this chapter, we're going to give you some ideas about how to position a house in the most weather-responsive way possible. For example, imagine a farmhouse with barns andoutbuildings on the side to help keep it warm in the winter. This would be a great way to do this.
### Approaching the House by Automobile

In this chapter, the narrator explains how people get lost in the modern world because they are tied to their cars. He explains that many of us don't like the idea of being tied to our automobiles because it means we live in an age where everyone has to leave the house and go back to work. This creates a sense of disarray amongst our clients and friends. We should try to avoid these common design pitfalls as they can save money by not forcing our guests to walk around the house too much.
### Creating a Sense of Arrival—SAAPE

In this chapter, the narrator gives us an example of how each step in the process of creating a perfect home is connected with a specific sequence of events. The first step is to see; the second is to approach; and the third is to enter. Each step has its own psychological significance, but it all starts with the idea that you're at your destination. For example, if you have a driveway that leads directly to your house, there's no way for visitors to feel like they've reached their destination. It's also important to note that many people don't realize how much space it takes to create such a circle around their house.
### Sequence of Interior Spaces

In this chapter, we get a brief history lesson on how people used to come and go through their houses. Back in the day, there was a lot of hallways and other open spaces where people would walk around and do their laundry. Now, however, most people end up going through their garage because they haven't had a place to feel like home. You could build a small hallway next to your garage so that people can drop their keys and hang out without feeling like they've "entered" your home.
### Stairways Need to Communicate Correctly

In this chapter, David explains why it is so often that people find their staircases in the main hallway. It is traditional for houses to have a central staircase as the center point of attention, but there are other ways to create a grand staircase that does not seem to be important at all. For example, in European houses, they had a second floor where the servants lived and were located above ground. This tradition still holds true today.
### A Stairway to Heaven

The narrator gives us some tips on how to make the most of your staircase. We recommend that you start with a good design and then work alongside your architect to get the look you're going for. There are some common mistakes people make when it comes to stairs, but these should be avoided since they're such high points in any home.
### Developing the Plan

The process of creating a three-dimentary house is very different than the process that goes down with a floor plan. First, you sketch out an idea, give yourself a critique and then revise it. Once you have something you like or when you need feedback from your clients, you review it all again with them. This time, however, everything changes.
### From Plan to House

In this chapter, Tommo focuses on the first two areas of building construction: massing and roof lines. First, he sketches out the proportions of the house so that he can begin to see how the structure will look once it is built. Second, if the house has a lot of windows, it will be easier to read through them than it is to draw simple elevations or perspective sketches. Third, though, even if all the details are very detailed, they still teach him what works and not.
### Some Rules of Composition

This chapter is all about how to make a house that looks good. It starts off with a few rules: the primary portion of your house should be tallest. The adjacent buildings should be capped with low and lower roof segments. A typical Pennsylvania farmhouse has two stories on the main block and three stories in the adjoining sections. These are because the whole building looks like it could push the ends into toward the center, which would collapse like an telescope
### Windows Are the Eyes and a Door Is the Mouth of the Building

The narrator goes on to explain how windows work as part of a building and how they can be used as a windowway. He also discusses French doors, which are sometimes used as entrances but are usually also used as windows.
### Using the Right Stuff

The narrator warns us that too often, in house design, we see excessive use of heavy materials like stone and brick above lighter, more permanent materials like wood. This is because there is no supporting frame for the heavy materials. Instead, heavy materials are the foundation and first walls of the house; they should be supported by thicker, stronger materials like concrete or stone. In other words, you can build a house that weighs twice as much as it actually is.
### Chimneys Are Spatial Markers

In this chapter, we continue to discuss the use of chimneys as symbols of space. They can be used as a bookend to a house and they can even serve as concealments from roof vents and pipes.
## Lesson Eleven

"Lorad's, it seems," and/or--totally intended as herald goes something like that: this--that is-- she comes to mean the guy who hasn't-- yet.
### THINKING THROUGH THE PLACES WHERE YOU LIVE

In this chapter, Frank breaks the tie between the rooms. He starts by stating that each room is like a puzzle to be solved. Each room has its own function and needs to be planned carefully. The more important issue is how the room will fit into the rest of the house. For example, one client asks Frank how to break a relationship between her husband and her wife. Frank suggests that if they were going to make a big decision, their husband should have the power to make the decision. If it involved something else, such as a special space, then his wife should break the association. Sometimes, however, a compromise can be reached.
### Kitchen—The Heart of the Home

Frank Lloyd Wright reaffirms that the American house is "the heart," and that it is the center of all human beings. He considers the kitchen to be the central part of the family life because it is where people gather, cook, and prepare meals. In his book, The Heart of the House, Frank Lloyd describes many different types of kitchens, from island-style kitchens to galley kitchens. Although there are many different versions of the classic work triangle, these basic rules remain the same.
### Dining—Breaking Bread Together

In this chapter, we get a detailed look at dining rooms. We'll start by asking ourselves what kind of dining room our family actually likes to have. It might be an informal dining room with heavy chairs and a table, or it might be a formal dining room that has more space for entertaining.
### Living—What We Do between Work and Sleep

In this chapter, Linda explains how to plan and build a living space. She goes on to talk about how important it is to have the right amount of space to house all the people you want in your home.
### Sleeping—Retreat from the Day

This chapter is all about how to get the most out of your house by making sure it's comfortable and organized. It starts off with a big picture: bedroom space should be nice and orderly so that sound and light doesn't interfere with each other. Most importantly, bedrooms aren't just rooms for sleeping; they should also be places where children or adults hang out. For instance, a child might have a room where he studies while his parents sleep. A bedroom could also be used as a place for homework. If you don't have kids around, try to create separate bedrooms. Master bedrooms often have sitting areas.
### Bathrooms—Just Functional or Luxurious?

In these, most private spaces of the house, a trend today is towards more elaborate bathrooms. The master suites and individual baths are an important part of any home. Because they are so expensive, it is important to have a well-planned bathroom. If there are too many potential requirements for specific features, you might be forced to leave the house because no one can get in or out of it. You should also consider how the space will interact with the other rooms in the house. For example, some people think that having a separate shower makes the room seem larger than it actually is. Other people think this is a bad idea because by adding a walk-in shower, anyone who falls out of their wheelchair will be able to enter the room without being blocked. This way, someone else won't have to go outside to help them. Finally, everyone needs a good understanding of what they really want in their master bathroom.
### Entry—The Guest Starts Here

The entry hall of your house begins the first impression that your guests will have. It is important to have a large enough space for all of them to arrive. There must also be a view of the outside, so that people can see into the house when they enter.
### Other Places—Work, Hobbies, Etc.

It's not enough to just list out all the rooms and places you want to have. You have to also think about how you use each room and space as a resource.
### Don’t Forget the Closets

The narrator gives us some tips on how to create more closet space in your new home. For example, you might want to hang out in a walkin closet, but then you'll have to hang up in crowded rooms like a bedroom. So here are some tips for making sure that your house has enough closet space. Front doors should be 36" wide at least, but there are other options: pocket doors or French doors. You can use pocket doors as a way to open and close without feeling like you're walking around the room.
### Trade-Offs

The narrator goes on to list some typical tradeoffs that will help you get the most out of your house while keeping costs down. These include: initial costs, life cycle costing, high-quality materials, and openness. Most importantly, rooms with high ceilings compete against the heat efficiency of the home. In order to get the best of everything, it's important to make sure all the light switches are in the right spot.
### The “Other Guy Syndrome”

In this chapter, Tommo explains how he gets his clients to worry about adding something that will not make the house more valuable. He calls this the "Others Guy Syndrome" because it means that when you design a house just for yourself, it won't sell.
### Aging with Your Perfect House

In this chapter, Linda lays out some universally-requited considerations that will help you age comfortably in your perfect house. These considerations are not requirements but simply food for thoughts. The first thing to do is to plan out how the house will be set up so that people who live there can easily move in and out of it. For example, a family would like to have a room that could serve as a home for their elderly parents or other family members who might need additional care.
### Design Tidbits

In this chapter, Frankenstein lays out some of his tips for building a perfect house. First, make sure you have plenty of room to work with. Second, think about where you want your entertainment system so you don't have to stand in front of it while everyone else is doing their work. Third, figure out how much space you need for the new home. Finally, ask your builder to order extra brick, stone, or other items that will last you years if you ever need them.
## Lesson Twelve

### OH, YES…THE BUDGET

After all, the home is the place to begin thinking about money. People often spend their money on things they don't really need, like a fancy house. In fact, many people end up spending too much on their dream house just to forget about how much they have to sacrifice in order to afford it.
### Face Reality

Jim argues that people tend to focus on what they want to hear, rather than what they really want to see. For example, a builders job might tell his client that the house will run about $150 per square foot, which is way too high a price for a typical home. The truth of the matter is that houses cost more than you think they are going to be. First, you have to figure out how much you need to spend and then calculate how much your house will actually cost once you've got this number set. If you don't start thinking about it now, however, you won't be able to make any changes to the budget before it's too late. Another problem many people face when thinking about building their house is that they compare the size of the house they want with the cost of other similar houses in their community. This is because there are lots of different types of homes available at the same time. It isn't necessarily cheaper to build a nicer house than buy a new one. There are also some advantages to building a custom-built house instead of buying a standard-sized house: A builder who builds a large variety of houses can save money by making better decisions about building materials and finishes.
### The Murkiness of Cost per Square Foot

In this chapter, the narrator gets back to the subject of cost per square feet. He tells us that some builders will include in their estimates parts of the house that don't need as much labor or materials as other areas. The naive home owner knows that there are different things that can make a house cost more than it actually is. For instance, some builders might include garages and porches with less space than others. All these extra pieces of space may be more expensive than they were originally going to be.
### Bang for the Buck

The narrator goes on to list some of the more cost-effective ways people can make their house more beautiful and more useful. He suggests that they get interior sound insulation, wood thresholds, and steel beams for an extra dollar. These are all inexpensive options that will make your house much more attractive.
### Elements with Significant Cost Consequences

The next time you're thinking about spending money on something, remember that some things are way more expensive than you thought. Curve walls, for example, cost twice as much as a room of high ceiling height. High spaces require more expense because it's more expensive to build and paint the walls. There are also higher-priced options: stone walls and porches. People often mistakenly think that these items don't cost anything but add square feet to the house. In fact, they might even be worth the expense. For example, a recent owner of a newly-built home had a spare refrigerator with his name on it. This means that the buyer didn't have to buy a new one, which is why many people will never want to buy another brand name appliance. Instead, they should choose what they like instead.
### Meet the Builder

Now that we've discussed the budget, it's time to find out who will build your house. If you haven't hired an architect or designer yet, then you need to hire a professional builder. The first thing you should ask is whether the builder has a good reputation in the town and how well his work is done. Finally, you want to see houses he's completed and compare them to the price range you're expecting.
### Things to Check Out in a Builder’s House

The following list of questions will help you determine whether a builder's job is in good condition and how well it is being done. These questions will also help you figure out whether the builder has enough experience to manage a large, complex project.
### Retainage

The retainage is a percentage that the builder takes from your monthly payment request. It is used to protect you against incurring a late payment by the builders when they overpay for the work completed to date or other defects that may be apparent later on. When the project is complete, the retainedage is paid back in full.
### Types of Construction Contracts

In this chapter, we discuss three different types of contract: fixed sum contracts, cost plus an hourly fee, and Cost plus a percent. A fixed-sum contract gives you assurance that all the costs will be correct, but it does not guarantee that everything will be exactly how the builder expected it to be. The most common type of cost-plus contract is one with a percentage, which means that all expenses can fluctuate according to the actual builder's estimates.
### Where Do We Go from Here?

This is the end of the book, but it doesn't quite end the entire process of building a house. It's still early in the construction phase, so let's check back in a bit. First things first: make sure you have all your options and follow through with everything you do. Next, take advantage of all the new tricks and tips that will help you get exactly what you want out of your new home.

### BUILDING GREEN, NATURALLY

The word "green" has become the most overblown word in architecture, homebuilding, and other fields. Everyone is claiming their product to be green, but there are ways to make it work. You can do more than just use less energy, you can build more sustainably, and you can save money on your bills.
### Design a Naturally Energy Efficient House

In this chapter, Tommo explains the five secrets to building an energy-efficient home: 1) design the house so its tends to remain at comfortable temperatures with mechanical assistance; 2) build a tightly and well-insulated house; 3) use low-energy appliances and fixtures; and 4) design the houses to naturally ventilatate. This is one of the most important secrets of all because it's essential to have proper sun exposure, heat gain, and coolness. If you're in a cold northern climate, you should try to let more sunlight into the house. Houses in the southern part of the world are better oriented on the land relative to the sky. They can easily control the sun's angle by using roof overhangings. The best way to do this is to place a porch close to the south side of your house where the sun doesn't get too high. Also, keep in mind how much heat will be lost during the summer when there's no air leak. A good house has enough holes, gaps, opening vents, pipes, and doors to prevent getting cold air from inside. Insulating the walls isn't as critical as some other measures people might think, but it still pays for itself through higher energy bills. It's not just about two to 3 percent of the total cost of construction that needs to be done. To make sure everything works out correctly, check out the federal government's "Secrets to Save Energy When Building" document. He lists the top things people should do to help save money when building. First, insulate their attic, windows, and then choose a better heating system. Next, look for less expensive light bulbs. Finally, consider choosing a water chiller rather than a conventional hot water heater. These types of heaters work great because they don't need to store hotwater. Second, a heatpump uses electricity instead of natural gas. Third, arranging the house properly makes it easier to get the right amount of sunlight. Fourth, placing skylights or chimneys near the house will allow them to draw in excess heat while also keeping the house cooler. Fifth, designing the house to effectively Ventilate Before houses are air-conditioned, careful attention is paid to ventilation. Many Southern houses have whole-house exhaust fans in order to pull fresh air into the Attic before it gets too hot. And lastly,
### Energy Efficient Building Materials

The narrator then gives some tips on how to build an energy-efficient home. Some of the most important things to consider are using energy-effictive building materials. For example, you can use lightweight steel framing instead of traditional wood studs. A wall made with a rigid foam insulation is clearly an efficient building material, but it might be a bit lower on the scale because the foam is usually an expandable polystrayene. Another way to help your house be more green is to fill in the cracks and gaps in the wall.
### Indoor Air Quality and VOCs

As we build more houses, we trap potentially harmful gases inside the house and make sure that they aren't trapped inside by using vents or airbeasts. Good ventilation is essential, but bad building products can also be harmful. There are many different kinds of chemicals in the world, including Volcanoes, which are a class of compounds that easily turn into vapors/gasses. Most building products are tested on single-components, not entire homes. Many building product companies are starting to offer low- or no-volcanic products making building healthier and safer than ever.
### Sustainable Design

The first thing to do when considering the benefits of building a new home is to make sure that all of your building's materials are made from as waste-free, renewable resources as possible. For example, bamboo can be considered "sustainably" because it grows fast and doesn't need to be replaced at all. But wood that has been managed properly will be more sustainable since it comes from forest owners who are Forest Stewardhip Council certified. You can also use wood from producers whom are FSC certified. If you want to know how you can check out whether the wood you're using comes from "semi-resourceful" sources, you have to use wood produced by Forest Stewdit Council members. There are many countries participating in this program so you can ensure that every stage of the production, process, and transformation comply with Foreststewardship Council's strict standards. Wood used for building can be counted on especially since it lasts so long. They require less energy to produce than other building materials; they don't pollute the earth or waterways, and there are no harmful chemicals in them. Finally, bricks and concrete can be used as replacements for old, broken, or damaged parts. These products reduce waste and increase the life of buildings. Reclaimed building materials like wood floors, doors, and roof slate are great examples of these types of building material that can be returned to their original state after being used in new construction.
### Renewable Energy Resources

The fourth step of green building is to use renewable energy. It can be used to power water-heating or geothermal devices, which extract heat from the earth instead of using electricity. By reducing your home's electricity consumption, you can help reduce the amount of fossil fuel consumed by power plants. A house with a Geothermal Heat Pump can save about 30 percent on its electric bill.





# Conclusions
It took me 2 hour to read and remind the general things discussed in this book. It helped me quite well and was fast.
It took me around 2 weeks and 2 hours per day to read entire book which means that summary allowed me to review 
entire book 14 times faster.
The summary of each chapter was good enough to catch the main idea because I have read entire book. 
I would put 7 / 10 for this summarization result since sometimes it was having some inconsistencies which I was able to
catch easily.
It would be interesting to see the experience of others who hasn't read the book.
