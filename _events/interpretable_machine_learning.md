## Overview

That meetup was held by [Data Science Tbilisi](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DataScienceTbilisi/). 
I was talking about Interpretable Machine Learning. Actually, it was pretty new for me 
since it became very popular on that period. I found one [book](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)
which was written by Christoph Molnar. It was pretty interesting. I had a little experience with interpretability things
in Machine Learning like: [ELI5](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/eli5/), [GradCam](https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam),
etc but I didn't know all the available methods well.
Since I was limited to 1 hour I wasn't able to present all the things so I showed only machine learning and not Deep Learning 
approaches. 
The most popular and widely used one in classical Machine Learning is [shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap). There 
are some use cases in Deep Learning also. 
The one I liked most is [GanPaint](http://gandissect.res.ibm.com/ganpaint.html).
I learned a lot from that book. It's pretty easy to read and doesn't take too much time. I recommend you to read it.
