# Short Summary
# Progress in Developing Georgian Universal Dependencies

I recently had the opportunity to deliver a talk at Ilia State University, where I shared the latest advancements in developing Georgian Universal Dependencies. In this presentation, I highlighted the model's performance, the accompanying dataset, and provided detailed insights into the ongoing progress.

## Model Showcase

I showcased the [Georgian Universal Dependencies model](https://www.anz2.website/nlp/unlocking-georgian-language-understanding-the-ud-treebank-project-at-ilia-state-university/) and discussed its performance, offering a comprehensive overview of the dataset we developed to support it.

## Integrating with Stanza

Excitingly, I shared our plans to integrate the model with Stanza, the Stanford NLP library. This integration will result in the availability of Stanza for Georgian, contributing to the broader NLP community.

## NLP Challenges and Competitions

Moving beyond the specifics of our work, I delved into broader NLP challenges, including classification, named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and more. I highlighted the perpetual competition between NLP benchmarks and the evolving models designed to surpass them, a driving force behind the development of cutting-edge language models.

## Evolution of Word Embeddings

The journey of word embeddings was a focal point of discussion. Starting from simple one-hot encoding to sophisticated models like BERT and GPT, I explored the evolution of techniques such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, RNNs (ELMo), and their respective pros and cons.

## Resources for Georgian NLP

I provided insights into the available resources for Georgian NLP, discussing datasets, models, benchmarks, and the need to strive for the same level of performance achieved in English NLP.

## Ongoing Initiatives

### KALMO: Open Research Organization

I introduced KALMO, an open research organization founded in October 2023, comprising a team of fewer than 10 members, mainly from the ex-MaxinAI ML Team. The organization is actively working on collecting and publishing a Georgian Large Corpora to support NLP research.

### Common Voice Project

I shared the progress of the Common Voice Project, which has made strides from 10 hours to 140 hours of speech data. This project is a valuable resource for enhancing speech-related NLP tasks.

### AI Lab: English to Georgian Translation

Another noteworthy initiative is the "AI Lab," an open research team focusing on English to Georgian translation. Led by a founder of PulsarAI, this team is actively contributing to language translation research.

### Ilia State University Projects

I briefly touched upon ongoing projects at Ilia State University, including the development of Georgian Universal Dependencies and a Georgian OCR Benchmark.

## Challenges in Open Sourcing Georgian Text Corpora

The conversation concluded with a discussion on the challenges of open-sourcing large text corpora in Georgian, emphasizing the stringent regulatory standards surrounding copyright laws.

In conclusion, it was both my pleasure and honor to be a part of this insightful conversation, and I look forward to the continued progress and collaboration within the NLP research community.
